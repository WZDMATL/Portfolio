<p>This is the source code to my personal portfolio website.</p> 

<br />

## How it's Built
<br />
<p>The website is built using HTML5 and CSS3. Flex-box and a cool scroll animation with reverse makes this portfolio pop with personality. </p> 

<br />

### HTML
Take a look through my [homepage] code. 
<br />
Also take a look at the following pages that are wrapped in <code>/project/</code> folder:
<br />
[About]
<br />
[Work]
<br />
[Contact]
<br />

<br />

### CSS
I styled the site by creating a <code>/css/</code> folder and establishing the [center.css] file for the entire site using the universal selector <code>*, ::after, ::before {}</code> method in the folder. Additional styling was added to the [style.css] file in the <code>/css/</code> folder.

<br />
